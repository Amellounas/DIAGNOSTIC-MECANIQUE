# DIAGNOSTIC-MECANIQUE

## LAB REPORT MECHANICAL DIAGNOSTICS
The analysis of gear reducer signals is essential in predictive maintenance and mechanical equipment reliability. This practical work focuses on studying the degradation of a gear reducer over 12 days, using data provided by CETIM. The reducer consists of two gears, one with 20 teeth and the other with 21 teeth. Analyzing this data will help identify potential anomalies.
## PRACTICAL WORK ON BEARING FAULT DETECTION
The objective of this Masterâ€™s project in Electronics and Electrical Energy is to develop indicators for detecting bearing defects. These indicators will be applied to a database containing multiple vibration signals collected from a test bench equipped with four bearings.
